	<description>This mod is based on Trader Ships by AUTOMATIC and their code is used under MIT license. Adds medieval trader airships to the game. Airships will visit your colony, preferring landing zones, and trade with you just like visiting caravans. Replaces orbital traders. Airship textures by Airo and Botch_Job! Thanks guys!
